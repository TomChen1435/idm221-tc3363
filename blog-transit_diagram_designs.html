    Transit Diagram Designs 

    Alongside the projects for User Interface Design and Interaction Design, I am always keen in finding more ways to advocate for public transit in the United States with an emphasis to promote rail public transit. Transit diagrams are so much more than the pieces of artwork hanging inside the stations and vehicles, they are the windows for people to overview and recognize their transit systems before using and implementing public transit into their lives. Feeling dissatisfied with the existing ones, I decided to make my own versions of them to help myself understand the systems better.
