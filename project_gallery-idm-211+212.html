    <title>SEPTA Website Redesign</title>
    <!-- UI Design Project -->
</head>
<body>
    The final project for my UI Design class is to redesign five pages of a website for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. For years, I have been a consistent advocate to promote public transit. Therefore, I anchored my topic for this project on redesigning the website of SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, the main transit operator in the Philadelphia metro area).
