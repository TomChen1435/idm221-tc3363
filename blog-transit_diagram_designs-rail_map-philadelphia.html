    Philadelphia Metro Area Rail Map 

    Being a Philadelphian, I always have conflicted thoughts and emotions for my native transit systems. It needs so many past-due updates and improvements to catch up with the rest of the world, but from the North American point of view, Philly is the “rail city” of the United States it has enough but not too much density with great backbones for all modes of rail public transit, from trolleys, light rails, subways, to regional commuter rails.
