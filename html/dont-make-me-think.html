            Don’t Make Me Think

            Steve Krug published the revised version of “Don’t Make Me Think” in 2013 as a renewal of the 2006 version, for some previously intuitive examples no longer existed, and several revolutionary technologies became popular, especially as the edgy smartphones gradually became mainstream along with the countless mobile applications, changing various aspects of people’s lives. The rapid change in the tech world motivated Krug to compose a third version of the book, implementing new ideas and principles while maintaining the goal of inspiring designers to build more usable products and make the interactions more straightforward for the users.

            After I read the preface, I was immediately attracted, not only because the nostalgic pictures reminded me of the Internet services I had as a child but also because I deeply agreed with Krug's messages: respect the user’s habits, simplify the flow, and provide clear and concise assistance. It felt familiar to me as the core belief coincided with NNGroup’s Usability Heuristics for UI Design, which I learned a few weeks ago in my UI 2 class.

            I was profoundly inspired by the portion “Make it obvious what’s clickable” in Chapter 3\. The author’s words made me realize a fatal mistake in my final project for the previously mentioned class, “In general, you’ll be fine if you… make sure that their shape and location identify them as clickable.” Krug believes that people tend to parse everything they see for interactive clues. Clearly distinguishing clickable components from others is a critical aspect of usability and, hence, a major task for the designers.

            The “Wild West” part of the timeline from 1997 to 2002 notified me of my lack of consideration. I forgot to unify the style of my buttons – each clickable component had a drastically different appearance. Mimicking the style of clickable text in the examples of “The Golden Age,” I reduced the types of buttons in my prototype to four and dedicated one typeface for all clickable components. The web page looked significantly neater after I followed this important rule.

            Another portion that affected my mindset was Krug’s explanation about navigation, where I found a second flaw in my prototype: not all pages straightforwardly informed the user where they were. I soon fixed the issue and made improvements with other suggestions Krug offered in this chapter. For instance, the site logo is now interactive and can bring the user directly back to the homepage, which is intuitive but mistakenly ignored previously.

            In conclusion, I greatly enjoyed this book and believe it is well-written. Krug’s writing style is easy to comprehend, just like the principle of conciseness he mentioned in Chapter 5. It never felt to me that I was reading sophisticated professional instructions or being struck with obscure terms. Instead, it felt like I was talking with the author without the awkwardness of stuttering. The frequent use of images also improved my reading experience to some extent. They provided buffer zones so that I was never overwhelmed with overloaded textual content. Briefly said, this was one of my best reading experiences recently.
