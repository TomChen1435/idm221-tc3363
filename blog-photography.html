    <h1>Tom's Photo Booth</h1>
    
    <h2>A Combination of City and Nature Landscapes</h2> 

    <p>Photography has been a significant part of my life for many years. I took related electives throughout the four years of high school, including AP 2-D Art and Design in which I focused on digital photography. It was one of the rare things that had brought me joy and kept me moving forward during those lonely days in the suburbia.</p>

    <p>The bland life in the adolescent years definitively shaped my patterns of thinking, especially for my artistic investigations. I became obsessed with the city landscapes and their fusion with nature. Hence, I traveled whenever I had spare time. As time passed, my earnest passion for this art of light gradually diverted onto the path of building a sustainable lifetime hobby.</p>

    <p>Up till this day, photography remains to be one of my sources of happiness. My camera is another pair of eyes capturing the astonishing moments of my life. Just like a diary, the emotions engraved within the photographs are timeless. I know I wonâ€™t be regretting when the pictures bring me back to those gems in my memory once again many years later.</p>
