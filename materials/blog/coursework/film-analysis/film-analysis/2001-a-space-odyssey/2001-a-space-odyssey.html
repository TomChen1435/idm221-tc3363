            <p>
                I saw the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey” online on the television at my aunt’s house. It was free to watch on a streaming service called “<a href="tubitv.com">Tubi TV</a>.” I watched the montage on Blackboard before watching the film. Along with the title, my first impression of the movie was that it was science-fiction and would involve a lot of strong contrasts between pure black and multiple high-key values, as most of the scenes would correlate to the idea of space traveling.

                <li>Description for the film's general plot</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The story of “2001: A Space Odyssey” begins with the orangutans living on ancient Earth. They obtained a higher level of wisdom from an alien. A long time passed before the moon landing project discovered a similar monolith that emitted a signal to Jupiter. To find the signal’s destination, a spaceship was sent to Jupiter, equipped with “HAL 9000,” an advanced computer similar to today’s artificial intelligence. The machine caused an incident and killed all astronauts except Dave. He then entered an unknown space and witnessed his entire life. To me, the best and worst parts are the ending of the film. It is an open ending, leaving plenty of imagination for the viewers but also making people confused.

            <h2>Scene Choice</h2>
            <ul class="secondary">
                <li>Selection for one scene on which I am concentrating</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In this essay, I will be focusing on a scene after Dave enters “Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite” at 2:02:10 of the film. The scene is composed of a great number of high-key radial thin lines originating from the center of the low-key background. There are also multiple ellipse-like curves circling the center where the lines intersect with one another.

            <h2>Visual Analysis</h2>
            <ul class="secondary">
                <li>Analysis for the chosen scene</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Actual lines are clearly the emphasis of this scene. Both rectilinear and curvilinear lines are well-represented in this scene. Although none of them are artificially generated, they look more geometric instead of organic. They are composed dynamically as most straight lines are slanted, which makes sense as this scene is made to demonstrate Dave passing through a long distance at a massive speed. Meanwhile, there are a great many shapes enclosed by the intersecting lines. However, even though most of the shapes are triangles and trapezoids, there is no visible motif or pattern in the image.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a partially one-point perspective image, and all of the rectilinear lines converge to the focal point at the center. Therefore, the image is also highly radial symmetrical with a great sense of balance, as the lines are fairly evenly distributed across the image. As mentioned earlier, this scene includes a strong contrast between the high-key rays and the pitch-black background. As a result, it would provide the viewers with a feeling of traveling into the unknown and let them resonate with the character.

            <h2>Analysis for the rest of the Film</h2>
            <ul class="secondary">
                <li>Visual concepts repeatedly seen throughout the film's design</li>
                <li>The film's visual style</li>
                <li>Overall effect regarding the mood and atmosphere</li>
                <li>Influence on my own thinking for visual designs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I repeatedly saw the visual concepts of contrast, symmetry, and space. The movie creates its space-traveling visual style by implementing strong contrasts between the high-key objects in the foreground and the blackness in the background. One overall effect is that the audience can easily emerge with an excitement of discovery. Personally, I am inspired by this visual style: I always feared that the high contrast would disturb the balance within the image, but “2001: A Space Odyssey” proved that my worries were unnecessary. I may try to include it in some of my future works.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <ul class="secondary">
                <li>Differences between analyzing a film and a 2-D work of art</li>
                <li>Challenges and surprises</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Analyzing a film is different from critiquing a two-dimensional work of art, primarily because there are too many scenes to choose from. That is, the process of analyzing a film is equivalent to that of comprehending a series of 2D works that build upon each other. It is not easy because each frame has its own function in telling the story – I must not analyze the scenes without the context of the film’s plot. The biggest surprise I had after watching the entire film was that I finally understood the definition of “timelessness.” 2001: A Space Odyssey was launched in 1968, but the visual effects and implied inspirations feel much more modern. It is truly a classic that deserves more praise and recommendations.
