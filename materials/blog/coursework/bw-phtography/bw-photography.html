    <h1>B&W Photography</h1>
    
    <p>It was the third term into my college life. I realized I needed more motivation to go out and explore my lovely city during the weekends. I deliberately changed my course sequence and took the photography class in the spring of 2024, hoping to give myself an opportunity to capture the liveliness of Philadelphia and its surrounding area.</p>
