                I watched the film Under the Sun, directed by Vitaly Mansky. It was a documentary produced by several studios and agencies, including Saxonia Entertainment. The current version, released at the end of October 2015, can be viewed for free on <a href="tubitv.com">tubitv.com</a>. The word “complicated” best summarizes my overall impression of the film’s use of color. As North Korea ordered the original work as a propaganda tool, some parts of the film used vibrant and saturated warm colors with an emphasis on various shades of red. The rest of the film is about behind-the-scenes stories of the filmmaking process that reveal the factual life in Pyongyang. For those portions, Mansky generally used more dull, low-saturated, cool colors, explicitly using a massive amount of white and desaturated cyan and teal.

            <h2>Scene Choice</h2>
            <ul class="secondary">
                <li>Selection for one scene which I will visually analyze</li>
                <li>Description for the scene in narrative terms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The scene that caught my attention the most was when the protagonist’s family had a scripted meal together. The director used many ingenuities to make it a heart-warming parent-children activity scene. However, the logical thinking and details of the shot made it one of the most ironic scenes of the entire film, as an ordinary family of three had an exaggerated nine-course lunch with huge bowls of soup.

            <h2>Visual Analysis</h2>
            <ul class="secondary">
                <li>Color schemes</li>
                <li>Transparency and contrast</li>
                <li>Composition</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There was this close-up shot of their food, including strong contrasts between the unsaturated white dishes, less-saturated blue table, highly saturated red kimchi soup, and extremely saturated brown rice cakes. The wooden floor in the background reflected a low-saturated tint of yellow-orange. As expected, almost all elements in the frame were warmer in color. The only components that involved transparency were the three glasses. They could easily be perceived as transparent objects because the parts of the table underneath the glasses had less brightness but the same hue and saturation.

            <p>
                The composition of the dishes was also worth mentioning. The dishes with red and orange colors were put at the center of the scene so that they could straightforwardly attract the audience’s attention. The second thing that the viewer would likely pay attention to was the plate of fried eggs at the bottom-left corner of the frame. Its bright, mildly saturated yellow color was much more active than most of the other food on the table. Overall, this scene is ordinarily composed as it was not set up to convey the ideas of aesthetics.

            <h2>Analysis Specific to the Film</h2>
            <ul class="secondary">
                <li>Description for the overall use of color</li>
                <li>Relationship between color tone and content</li>
                <li>Two different color scenes used to create contrasting moods</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As I mentioned at the beginning of this analysis, the film had two different color tones. They could be represented by the two scenes above. A larger portion of Under the Sun, which focuses on North Korea’s social reality, uses an opposite coloring style from the previously mentioned scene. In the propaganda part, the tone was either beige, which created a relaxing atmosphere for the narrative, or a shade of red, as the people’s clothes at the ceremonies commonly used saturated red, bright brown, and black. As for the rest, the tones were mostly low-saturated cyan, teal, or gray. It could render a more depressing mood as those colors are not only passive but low in chroma, too.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <ul class="secondary">
                <li>Differences between analyzing a film and a 2-D work of art</li>
                <li>Challenges and surprises</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Analyzing a film is different from critiquing a two-dimensional work of art, primarily because a film is made up of a great number of 2D works. Therefore, analyzing a film is equivalent to comprehending a series of 2D works that build upon each other. Each frame plays a different role in telling the story – it cannot be truly analyzed without the context of the film’s plot. After watching the entire film, the biggest surprise was that I realized two entirely different stories could also share a single timeline. The miserable reality could, in fact, increase the level of irony of scripted propaganda.
