    <h1>SEPTA Website Remake</h1>

    <p>A project for my UI Design class is to redesign five pages of a website for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.</p>

    <h2>Why This Topic?</h2>
    
    <p>For years, I have been a consistent advocate to promote public transit. Therefore, I anchored my topic for this project on redesigning the website of SEPTA.</p>

    <p class="small">SEPTA is the abbreviation of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, the main transit operator in the Philadelphia metropolitan area</p>
